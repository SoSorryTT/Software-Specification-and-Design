## Petrol Fuel Prices

Get the current petrol fuel prices from a web service provided by Bangchak,
and print them on the console.

The web service seems to *lie* about yesterday's prices.  The price change
from yesterday to today is always zero.  But if you go to Bangchak's web
page of historical prices, you can see when price changes actually occurred.
